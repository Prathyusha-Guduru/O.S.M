What we had in mind when we built this ?

Among all the deaths that occur in the Emergency departments, 23.8% were due to preventable causes.This percentage can be clearly reduced if the doctors operated on the patients a little early.So it the doctor's fault then? No. Doctors are not able to act quick because they have to check the patient's health status which most of time includes blood group,drug allergies and common diseases like high blood pressure or diabetes the patient might be having.Even with the highly sophisticated medical equipment we have right now, it takes atleatt 2 to 3 hours to run all these tests.This is what we wanted to solve using a Quick Response code(QR Code).One click and all the medical history of the patient in doctor's hands.
We also wanted to expand our platform
